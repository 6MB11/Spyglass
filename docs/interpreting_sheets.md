# Interpreting a Spyglass Sheet

To help users identify regions of interest in the R/D metagame, regions in Spyglass sheets are color-coded and marked in columns A and B based on if they have a founder, if they have a World Assembly delegate, and if the delegate has executive powers. These markers can be used with Excel's built-in filter function to quickly identify regions of interest.

-   GREEN — Region is founderless and passwordless
-   YELLOW — Region has an executive WA delegate and is passwordless
-   RED — Region has non-executive WA delegate and is passwordless
-   `~` — Region can be tagged
-   `*` — Region has non-executive WA delegate

Additionally, regions with zero WAD endorsements are color-coded red in column H, which shows the region's endorsement count.

Spyglass also lists a region's embassies and the first 140 characters from their WFE in columns I and J. These columns can be used to identify regions that have been tagged by military gameplayers.
